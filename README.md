# f1-score
This Python script makes four plots viz. precision-recall, precision, recall and f1-score .
This script is mostly targeted towards result.txt file generated by YOLOV3/4/5 CNN architecture.
Besides, ignoring values with '0' in numerator, denominator as well as in both, this script also
embeds a function that interpolates "NaN" values to generate a smooth and continuous plot for F-1 score.
This script also annotates the maximum value of f-1 score.
